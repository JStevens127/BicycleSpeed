Concept iOS app in Swift  to connect to a Cycling Speed & Cadence Sensor.

It connects to a Bluetooth peripheral that provides the Speed & Cadence Service (**1816**) to display the sensor information and the measurements (Speed, Distance, Pedal Cadence)

Tested only with a Runtastic RUNSCS1 device. Other sensors providing the service **1816** should also work.
